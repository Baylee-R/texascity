    <p>Since Texas City in located in the center of Iowa and it is a big city for Iowa it is not that hard to find. Really all you have to do is type into your GPS Texas City, Iowa or you can look in a map to look for roads to get there! Texas City is about 2 hours away from the border to Missouri.</p> <!-- Rewording was done on line 24-->
